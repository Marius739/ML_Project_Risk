## Intro
This is a simple machine learning model for a project


## Required Packages
To run the file you need those specific packages.
To install the necessary packages from the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Marius739/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Project_Risk/requirements.txt) file you need this command line

if you are using venv from Anaconda :
```bash
$ conda install --file requirements.txt
```
if you are using pip :
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Script and Notebook
To run the .py file : 
```bash
$ python predict_risk.py --output predictions.csv
```
You can replace "predictions.csv" with another name. Note that the file will be created in the same file as the script
For the notebook 

You will also find the [training](https://github.com/Marius739/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Project_Risk/training_dataset.csv) and the [final test](https://github.com/Marius739/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Project_Risk/final_test.csv) datasets for the model.
